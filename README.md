# Decentragram ðŸ’¸

Decentragram  is a decentralized application developed for content creators to share their content and earn directly from entities.The Decentralized application is built using truffle and ganache-cli. With the user-friendly interface, creators can post the content into the application by paying a small amount of ethers for confirming the transaction. After posting, the content can be viewed on the application and another interesting feature is tipping of content posted. People can directly tip their liked content where the ethers would directly go to the creatorâ€™s account.

To start the application, run the following commands

```
ganache-cli

truffle migrate

npm start

```
